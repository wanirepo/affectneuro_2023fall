## Download
You can download the class materials using the following command line:

	$ git clone https://github.com/wanirepo/affectneuro_2023fall

Once you clone the github repository, you can just type the following command to get the updated github repository:

	$ git pull
	
Or you can download the repository as a zip file or you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). The class materials will be uploaded (e.g., lecture slides, assignments) before each class. 

There is a good github tutorial: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)

## What are the aims of this course?

Joyful, happy, sad, angry, disgusting, painful, bored... we experience these emotions all the time, and these experiences keep changing every moment. How can we "define" emotions? How can we "study" emotions? What are the "bodily factors" that influence emotions? How do we "measure" bodily response to emotions? What are the "brain representations" of emotions? Are emotions the same as affect or feelings? How can we model the "dynamics" of emotions? What are the underlying problems in emotional disorders, like anxiety and depression? etc. There are so many interesting questions about emotions. 

In this class, we will learn 1) key topics of affective neuroscience. 2) We will also invite some researchers to hear more about ongoing studies on pain and emotions and 3) have some debate sessions on controversial topics. 

## Course format and expectations

This class uses the flipped classroom format, which means that I will assign video lectures to watch before class each week. The class will go on with the assumption that you watched the video lectures and focus more on deeper and useful discussion and activity. I personally experienced this format of learning during my Ph.D. (for the Machine Learning class) and deeply enjoyed it. I found the flipped classroom helped students stay engaged and provided a good environment for hands-on experience. For these reasons, I have wanted to do the class with the flipped classroom format. To make this flipped class work, you 1) really need to watch the video lectures in advance, 2) attend the class, and 3) actively participate in the class activity. 

## Evaluation

This class will use absolute evaluation, which does not mean that you will get a good grade no matter what. Rather, it means that your learning will be evaluated strictly based on the following standard:

1. Attendance (40%): Again, attendance is important
2. Term project (15%): We will do a term project, which will start around the mid-term season and finish before the final exam
3. Paper presentation & Debate (15%): Graduate students will do the journal club, and undergrad students will do debates. 
4. Class preparation (15%): You need to watch lectures (or read an assigned article) before coming to the class and **submit one discussion question** for every video lecture
5. Discussion participation (15%): Please participate in class discussion actively

Grade criteria: 
A+: > 95,
A: > 90,
B+: > 85,
B: > 80,
C+: > 75,
C: > 70

## Response to video lectures

Please submit your discussion questions and comments for each video lecture through [this google form](https://forms.gle/JqmR8zt5ePmZ3XY37)

## Term project

Develop your own research idea related to affective neuroscience. You can choose any topic within the area of affective neuroscience. You will have two times of presentation opportunity--one for research background (similar to the introduction section of a research article), and the other for experimental design (similar to the method section of a research article). If you are conducting research projects for your dissertation, you can use this as an opportunity to write parts of your dissertation. I am also considering forming teams (of one graduate student and one undergrad student). Let's discuss this in the class.
